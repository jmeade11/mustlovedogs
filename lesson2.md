# Understanding Ionic Development
This won't be a comprehensive explanation of how Ionic applications work, but I think it's important to understand some of the basic concepts, as well as the file structure of your project before diving into the development.

## Ionic is built on Angular
Ionic is built on the Angular framework.  Angular is a Javascript framework.  It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax with your own elements.  So, what all this means is that you can create your own tags to use in HTML, such as `<my-thing></my-thing>`.  The `my-thing` element you create is made up of real HTML elements (that's the HTML template part), plus CSS, and some logic that you write in Javascript.  It's all packaged up into what's called a component. When a page with the `<my-thing>` element is requested by a user, the Angular framework intercepts the request, unpacks all of the component parts and sends the native HTML elements — based on the template you've designed — along with the associated styles and logic to the browser.  

For example, let's say you want to create a login component that you'll call `<my-login>`.  You might design an HTML template that contains a `form` tag, some `input` tags, some labels, and some error text.  You might then have some basic styles that set the error text to red and bold.  Finally, you might have some logic that does your error checking and has a method for handling of passing the form values once the submit button is clicked.  Now, you'd have a nice, **reuseable** component.  Inside your page where you want your login to appear, you'd add `<my-login></my-login>` and when the user lands on the login page, Angular would intercept the page request; go find the `my-login` component; grab the html, styles and logic; and then return them to the user's browser so that it could parse it and display it just like it would any other page returned from the server.

Angular has lots of things baked into the framework that make it incredibly powerful, including some pre-built element and attribute components (yes, you can also build my-thing that you add as an attribute to straight-up HTML elements to basically turbocharge them with your own logic). We call this [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar), meaning that it makes working with the language *sweeter for human consumption*.  Underneath the hood, so to speak, it's all just Javascript.  The framework just makes working with Javascript easier and better when you're creating complex apps.

## Why Use Ionic If Angular Is so Great?
Ionic takes full advantage of Angular and adds its own dash of syntactic sugar on top.  It adds quite a few [components](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#overview), most of which are optimized for operation on mobile devices, and designed to mirror the look, feel and behavior of mobile application elements.  Nearly all of the Ionic components also morph automatically to match the OS style of the device on which they are running.   In other words, the same list element looks like an iOS-style list when run on an iPhone, but like the Android styled lists on a Samsung.

Ionic also adds some other powerful features to mobile development that you won't get with Angular out of the box.  Namely, you get an API for working with Cordova. Remember I said I'd explain what that was later?  That's now. :smiley:
